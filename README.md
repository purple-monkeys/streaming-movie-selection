### Microsoft is Joining the Streaming Race
Author: Katie Whitson
Overview: Microsoft feels left out of the streaming services. They want to join Apple, Netflix, and Amazon in the original content battle. I will be showing how much money should be budgeted, when the movie should be released, and what type of movie should be produced. This will be determined from the data on Box Office Mojo, IMDB, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. After the analysis, the head of Microsoft's movie studio should be able to better determine what to start with.
### Method
I am determining the PIR, profit investment return, of all movies we have data on. I will use the top 10% to answer the following questions. Then, compare to the whole to see if any value is represented more in the top than the whole.
- What should the budget be?
- When should the release date be?
- What genre should the movie be?
### Results

### Final Conclusions
I would recommend:
- Setting a maximum budget of $15 million
- Releasing in either January, July, or November
- Doing a genre that falls in any of the following genres:
   - Drama
   - Horror, the second most over-represented
   - Mystery, the first most over-represented
   - Romance
   - Thriller

These categories are all over-represented in the top 10% population of the data indicating that they have a higher probability of turining a larger rate of return. They may not have the highest net gross, but per dollar spent more appear to be returned.
